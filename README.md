Plastic- ~80g one robot, recommendation - filalab.shop

Screws:
6mm round 4pcs (for mounting the pcb)
6mm flat 9pcs (countersunk) (for top panel and front panel mounting)
10mm flat 4pcs (countersunk) (for side panel mounting)
20mm flat 8pcs (countersunk) (for motor mounting

PCB 30pcs ~15eur
PCB has two input voltage connectors. You can use the second connector for connecting a second battery, internal charger or another device (for example - ESC). The pcb also has a LED thats connected to D23 and is programmable and also it has an expension port for servo or esc use. 

Batteries - you can use any 1s lithium battery, the 3d files have a slot for 18650 but for real fights it's too heavy. Another cheap option are vape batteries that prefferably are >400mAh. With 1 battery you can expect quite a long run time still. 
If you decide to use vape battery, then the weight of the robot will be ~190g if the plastic used is PLA or PETG. 

You can also use 2s batteries, but the total price would increase by ~5eur. The cheapest available 2s batteries are from Chinahobbyline.
